# Multilingual-Speech-to-Text-Transcription-and-Sentiment-Analysis

### Project Overview
This project aims to develop a multilingual speech-to-text transcription system integrated with sentiment analysis. The system will be capable of transcribing spoken language into text across multiple languages and analyzing the sentiment of the transcribed text. The project addresses several key aspects of natural language processing (NLP) and speech technology, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), language identification, and sentiment analysis. It leverages modern machine learning techniques, large-scale datasets, and high-performance computing to handle the complexities of multilingual speech processing.

### Project Goals
##### Multilingual Speech Recognition: Develop an ASR system capable of transcribing speech in multiple languages, with a focus on accuracy and efficiency.
##### Language Identification: Implement a language identification module to detect the language of the spoken input before transcription.
##### Sentiment Analysis: Integrate a sentiment analysis module to evaluate the emotional tone of the transcribed text.
##### User Interface: Create a user-friendly interface where users can upload or stream audio, select the desired language, and receive both transcriptions and sentiment analysis results.
##### Scalability: Ensure that the system can scale to handle large datasets and multiple simultaneous users.

### Implementation Steps
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Collect and preprocess large multilingual speech datasets, ensuring they cover a variety of languages and dialects. These datasets should include labeled data for training both the ASR and sentiment analysis models.
2. Multilingual Speech Recognition
Train a deep learning-based ASR model (e.g., Wav2Vec 2.0) for multilingual speech recognition. The model should be capable of accurately transcribing speech in multiple languages.
3. Language Identification
Develop or integrate a language identification model that can detect the language spoken in the audio input before it is passed to the ASR model.
4. Sentiment Analysis
Integrate a sentiment analysis module using a pre-trained transformer model (e.g., BERT) to evaluate the sentiment of the transcribed text.
5. User Interface
Create a simple web interface where users can upload or stream audio, select a language, and receive transcriptions along with sentiment analysis.
6. Scalability and Performance Optimization
Optimize the system for handling large datasets and simultaneous requests by implementing techniques like batching, model quantization, and leveraging GPUs or TPUs.
